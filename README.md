GADGET-4
========

![](documentation/img/top.jpg)

GADGET-4 is a massively parallel code for N-body/hydrodynamical
cosmological simulations. It is a flexible code that can be applied to
a variety of different types of simulations, offering a number of
sophisticated simulation algorithms.  An account of the numerical
algorithms employed by the code is given in the original code paper,
subsequent publications, and this documentation.

GADGET-4 was written mainly by
[Volker Springel](mailto:vspringel@mpa-garching.mpg.de), with
important contributions and suggestions being made by numerous people,
including [Ruediger Pakmor](mailto:rpakmor@mpa-garching.mpg.de),
[Oliver Zier](mailto:ozier@mpa-garching.mpg.de), and
[Martin Reinecke](mailto:martin@mpa-garching.mpg.de).
